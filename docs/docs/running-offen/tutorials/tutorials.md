# Other installation options

Other and more complex configuration options are documented in ["Configuring the application at runtime"][config-docs]. General considerations for deploying Offen Fair Web Analytics are described in ["Requirements for installing"][installation].

If you're curious about how we deploy Offen Fair Web Analytics yourselves, head over to our [`offen/deployment` repository][deployment-repo] which contains all of the code we use released to the public domain.

If you have questions about configuring and deploying Offen Fair Web Analytics on Ubuntu or any other Linux system that are not covered in this tutorial feel free to [open an issue in our GitHub repository][issues] or send us an email at <hioffen@posteo.de>.
